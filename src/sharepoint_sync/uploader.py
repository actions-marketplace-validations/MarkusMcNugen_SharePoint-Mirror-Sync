    Recursively create folder structure in SharePoint if it doesn't exist using Graph API.

    This function handles nested folder creation, ensuring the entire path
    exists before uploading files. It uses caching to avoid redundant API calls.

    Args:
        site_id (str): SharePoint site ID
        drive_id (str): SharePoint drive ID
        parent_item_id (str): Parent folder item ID where structure should be created

        client_id (str): Azure AD application client ID
        client_secret (str): Azure AD application client secret

        graph_endpoint (str): Microsoft Graph API endpoint
        folder_cache (dict): Optional folder cache from build_sharepoint_cache()
            Keys are folder paths, values are dicts with 'item_id' and 'name'

    Returns:
        str: The item ID of the final folder in the path, ready to receive files

    Raises:

    Note:
        - Caches created folders to minimize API calls
